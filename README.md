# Nasheed App Backend

This is the backend for the Nasheed app, developed using Laravel. The backend handles the music library, user subscriptions, and categorization of Nasheeds based on various criteria.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- PHP >= 8.1
- Composer
- MySQL or any other supported database
- Node.js & npm/yarn (optional, for frontend dependencies)
- Git

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/nasheed-app-backend.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd nasheed-app-backend
   ```

3. **Install Composer Dependencies**

   Install the PHP dependencies using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

4. **Environment Setup**

   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:

     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env
     ```

   - Update the `.env` file with your database credentials and other configurations:

     ```plaintext
     DB_CONNECTION=mysql
     DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
     DB_PORT=3306
     DB_DATABASE=nasheed_db
     DB_USERNAME=your_db_username
     DB_PASSWORD=your_db_password
     ```

5. **Generate Application Key**

   Generate the application key to secure user sessions and other encrypted data:

   ```bash
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

6. **Run Migrations**

   Run the database migrations to set up the necessary tables:

   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **Seed the Database (Optional)**

   You can seed the database with initial data:

   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

8. **Serve the Application**

   Start the local development server:

   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.
